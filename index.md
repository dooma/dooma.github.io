title: About
---

I have a strong passion for programming and open source ecosystem. I like to write
good software as much as possible using Ruby programming language.

Daily, I spend my time building applications using Ruby on Rails framework,
`GIT` versioning system, `GVIM` editor, `Terminator` and as OS I use `Ubuntu 12.04`.

I took part in [Coursewa.re](http://coursewa.re) adventure, which is very flexible
and customizable LMS. Now it is open source!

In past, I was a Google Code In participant(2011, 2012 and the last edition, 2013),
where I finished a lot of tasks for multiple open source projects.
It was a great opportunity to improve my programming skills, build tools to deploy applications, and so on.

In case you want to tell me something interesting,
you find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/dooma) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/calinutz96).

_Currently, I am not available for hiring or freelance work. Sorry!_
